Making an IoT based SoundBox for KarunyaCares App Integration

Description: This project is an IoT-based soundbox that reads aloud the food orders made by the users of the Karunya Cares App. 
It retrieves the orders one by one of each user from the database and continues the process for each user upon the press of a button.
